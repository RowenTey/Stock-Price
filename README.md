# 📈 Stock-Price-Predictor 
*A web app that allows users to predict stock prices using LSTM and compare them to actual prices.*

## 🧪 Tech 

This website is fully coded with Python, utilising the `Streamlit` module to structure our web app.  

The `Matplotlib` library was also used to visualize our data and construct our charts.

Our stock price prediction model is LSTM, built using Data Science and Machine Learning libraries like `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Keras` and `Tensorflow`. 

## ❓ Assignment

*Problem Statement*: Current LSTM price prediction models can be easily thrown off by black swan events akin to Covid-19.

*Our Solution*: We hypothesise that black swan events are characterised by sudden spikes in trading volume. For example, when there is rapid buying or selling in a short amount of time. Our app allows students, professionals and enthusiasts alike to study the relationship between trade volume and the accuracy of LSTM predictions relative to actual prices.

## ⚙ How To Use
First, type in the **ticker** symbol you're looking for.  
Next, click the arrow icon on the top left corner. This opens up a sidebar. Select the date you wish to start predicting the stock price from.  
Give a moment for the model to process your input.  
And that's it! The prediction will appear magically before your eyes. It's that **easy**!
